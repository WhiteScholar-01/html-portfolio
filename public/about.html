<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Saqib Ali, a passionate software engineer with a penchant for solving complex problems and creating elegant solutions.
   My journey in the world of code began with a fascination for algorithms and a desire to build things that matter.</p>

<p>Fusion 360: I have embraced this powerful tool for 3D modeling, parametric design, and simulation. 
  It allows me to visualize product ideas in three dimensions, from conceptual sketches to photorealistic renders.
</p>

<p>Computer Vision and Generative AI: I have explored image recognition, object tracking, and facial analysis. 
  Generative AI, with its promise of creativity, captivates me. Can AI dream? Can it imagine novel architectures
  or poetic verses? These questions fuel my curiosity</p>

<p>
  PCB Design (KiCad): Navigating electronic circuits virtually, I have ventured into PCB design.
  From schematic capture to layout, KiCad empowers me to create custom circuit boards. 
  I envision circuits powering smart devices and IoT marvels
</p>

<p>
  Proteus Professional 8: In this digital playground, I simulate circuitsâ€”watching voltage waveforms ripple,
  LEDs blink, and motors spin. Proteus becomes my canvas, where I debug, iterate, and fine-tune.
